The landscape is covered with coconut palms in the coastal areas. The paddy fields shimmer with the emerald green of new shoots. The banana plantations are filled with the whisper of waving green banana leaves. The tea plantations are a green blanket that cover the hill ranges as far as the eye can see, and the backwaters are fringed with Pandanus plants that trail the tips of their long leaves in the rippling water, as you float by. The verdant beauty of Kerala is richly highlighted through the different eco tourism destinations.The hill stations,western ghats,silent valley,the wildlife sanctuaries,jungles and parks are all splendid eco tourism destinations. <br><br>

Eco tourism is all about being sensitive to ones surroundings and the need to preserve nature.The greenery that abounds in Kerala is not only relaxing but also refreshing. The green patch that is Kerala offers shelter to some of the best plant, bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species.
