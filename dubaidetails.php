<b>History of Dubai</b><br>
The city of Dubai lies in the emirate of Dubai in United Arab Emirates (UAE). Owing to less archaeological findings, the origin and early history of Dubai is less known. Its recorded history dates back to the mid-19th century when the Maktoum Family, belonging to Bani Yas tribe, arrived here and settled at the creek. Dubai soon emerged as an important trading centre dealing mainly in pearls and fish. By 20th century, the Deira side of the creek came up with over 350 shops, which attracted both tourists and businessmen. Soon, in the 1950s, it was realised that the creek began to silt. Then, it was decided to have the waterway dredged, which resulted in better cargo handling, thus, earning Dubai a name in the trade industry. However, the city experienced a major change in the late 1960s, when oil was discovered here and revenues earned from its trade improved the overall infrastructure of Dubai. In the last two decades of the 20th century, the city's government decided to take a shift and make Dubai an international tourism hub. A great amount of investment was done to handsomely improve the transport system and accommodation options that brought positive results for the city.
